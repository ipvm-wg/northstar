This document is an informal description of IPVM's high-level goals. It forms the basis for reasoning about the project from first principles. It expected to only rarely change.

This is meant to provide the basis for reasoning from first principles, but it is written in prose and not first-order logic. It "merely" provides a basis for aligning the people working on the project. Principles often contain some limited internal tension: use your best judgment and discuss with your peers when ambiguities inevitably arise.

This text should be kept short, to the point, and as unambiguous as possible. Define any project-specific jargon, avoid editorializing, and limit subtle language. Use diagrams and imagery where appropriate.

# Raison d'ÃŠtre

> Had the [Web] been proprietary, and in my total control, it would probably not have taken off. You canâ€™t propose that something be a universal space and at the same time keep control of it.

IPVM intends to do nothing less than connect all of the world's users and services. It can be thought of as "the HTTP of compute": open, interoperable, and everywhere. Following the model of the Web being the network of linked documents, IPVM is the network of linked computation. It allows anyone to permissionlessly tie into the network without prenegotiation.

TCP/IP and HTTP were successful for a number of reasons. Networking was always possible, but doing this from scratch for every application is infeasible. Hypertext provided a single mechanism for many applications to interconnect. Application agnosticism is a major pillar of [such an approach][W3F Principles]: anything can run on this substrate, and it's easy to join. IPVM works equally well with traditional Cloud-based services as it does local-first compute and trustless architectures. To be successful, IPVM must have a path towards becoming substantially better than a pure Cloud architecture. It does not stand in opposition to the Cloud, but rather extends and contains it.

The internet is no longer purely client/server. Consumer devices are now significantly more powerful than when the LAMP stack and Cloud infrastructure were being co-developed. Devices today are heterogeneous: there are powerful browsers, heavy servers, microservices, edge PoPs, tiny IoT devices, smartphones, and commons networks like BitTorrent, IPFS, and blockchains. IPVM provides a way to tie applications together with robust invocation, routing, and trust layers. The volume of data that modern applications requires leads to a situation known as data gravity. Given the speed of light, the amount of data that we produce and modify grows faster than is possible to sync to all locations, and .

# Audience

IPVM is intended for general distributed computation, but excels at tasks that would be found in systems like Lambda Step functions. The IPVM network itself is focused on machine-to-machine interaction â€” where each node acts as the user's agent â€” but is not expected to be interacted with directly when on the happy path.

# Goals

IPVM means to provide:

- Task matchmaking network / marketplace
- Pluggable execution engine
- A trust layer (e.g. verifiable compute, encryption, PKI, capabilities)
- Seamlessly tie together external services
- Interfaces open to extension
- First-class P2P payments

IPVM is application agnostic, but intends to abstract concerns of locality away from the programmer.

## Antigoals

IPVM will _not_ attempt to develop into a:

- replacement or upgrade of IPFS internals
- high level language for distributed applications
- custom Wasm runtime
- blockchain or other global consensus mechanism

IPVM's focus is on execution, networking, data flow, and trust. It is important to make the internals debuggable and friendly where possible, but only when it doesn't conflict with the core aim at this layer: efficiency and abstracting away distributed systems concerns.

IPVM's primary focus is on machines and efficiency. Human-friendliness is important, but many human-oriented features should be pushed into higher layers. These may include high-level APIs, language integration, etc.

# Design Principles

> You can prove anything you want by coldly logical reason â€” if you pick the proper postulates.
> 
> â€” Asimov, "I, Robot"

1. Proliferate!
2. Open world / extension without prenegotiation
3. Participatory: anyone can consume, serve, or both
4. Learn into our strengths: IPVM is not k8s, so don't try to be
5. Common things should be simple, and complex things should be possible
6. Handle low-level details (networking, failure, trust) so that others can focus on business logic
7. Build in layers with clear audiences (machine-to-machine, end-user, etc)

When in doubt, optimize for proliferation. Get implementations into many hands, find services that already tie-in at the RPC and trust layers ([UCAN]), and avoid having the core IPVM team become a bottleneck for extending the network. [Richard Gabriel] described Unix and C as being like (helpful) computer viruses due to how they spread and integrate with other systems.

IPVM simplifies distributed dataflow. It's tempting to think of it as moving unconstrained centralized code to a logically centralized executor, but IPVM actually lowers the barrier of entry to distributed code. A distributed context is fundamentally different from writing code for a single machine[^LamportsProblem].

[Homestar] is the reference implementation of the IPVM protocol. Homestar is intended to be largely self-contained, and to run on as many systems as possible.

[^LamportsProblem]: As Leslie Lamport says, "a distributed system is one in which the failure of a machine you have never heard of can cause your own machine to become unusable".

## Easy for Who?

> Simplicity is a prerequisite for reliability

> Every application has an inherent amount of complexity that cannot be removed or hidden. Instead, it must be dealt with, either in product development or in user interaction.

The word "simple" is often used to mean "to make a common use case easy". This is goal directed: "simple for who or what?" IPVM aims to make distributed computing easy by abstracting away the common challenges of that context. In the same way that TCP/IP handles machine-to-machine networking concerns in an application agnostic way, IPVM doesn't attempt to enforce what can be run on it.

Per [Tesler's Law], solving these [common problems for the distributed setting][Fallacies of Distributed Computing] does mean that something has to be traded off. Running arbitrary code designed for local-only execution doesn't work in these settings. Much like depending on techniques like read-your-writes or CRDTs at the data layer, IPVM requires low-level implementations use certain tools and techniques. Following the tactic of "do one thing well", concerns of providing familiarity is pushed above the network layer to good libraries and tools.
